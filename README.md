# hello-world
This is my first repository for github 

If I had some code for an app, I could add it here for users to learn.

about the authors: 

Dr. Vandenbrink is a tenure-track professor in Bioinfamatics. His passion is for educating the youth in computational biology languages! He also spends way too much time on youtube and editing his videos for his own personal good.
